Hello and thanks for taking the time to evaluate my assignment.
-Overall I tried to use an MVP pattern.
-I tried not to make large scale modifications to the overall structure of the project. However, I did extract the
logic from the BossView and HumanView.
-The Upgrade system compromises of UpgradeManager, UpgradeView, UpgradeModel and UpgradePresenter. UpgradeManager is
used for dependencies.
-I added health bars to humans and bosses.
-DOTween was used to add feedbacks to the interactions between bosses and humans. Although I did not have to use
this asset, I had to use it because of time constraints.
-I did not pay attention to the visuals and did not use external visual assets as I did not prefer to use my limited
time on them. I focused more on the architecture, readability, maintainability and extensibility.
-There are 3 types of upgrades. Health, Damage and Training Speed. Health increases human health, damage increases
human damage and Training Speed decreases the time to train the humans. Each upgrade has 10 levels, different costs and
different values.
-The HP of the boss was increased to 10000 to make everything more understandable and to make testing easier.
-I grouped the assets that I created into one folder so you wouldn't have trouble finding them. Normally they would
be placed in their own systems.
-The project was implemented using Unity 2022.3.22f1 version.
-It took about 4.5 hours to finish.
